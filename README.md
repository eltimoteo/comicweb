I built this page to catalog my growing collection of Marvel and DC comics. 
This is built upon and directly linked to a Google Spreadsheet, where my personal data is tracked, stored, and updated. 
I wish to continue to add more features in the future and I hope, through this page, you find comics just as interesting as I do!
